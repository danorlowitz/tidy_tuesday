3/16

-   Created base file

-   Tried to convert avg_peak_perc to numerals

-   Spent the evening trying to figure out why mutate() wasn't working

-   Was taught on RD4S Slack that tt_load creates a list of frames, even if that list is 1 frame long, and that you have to load that frame for everything to work

-   Discovered that this dataset includes data from 2012 through 2021, not just 2021.
